Scenario 1: 
Background: Tomer and Stan are accused of murder. The prosecution relies primarily on eyewitness testimonies that identified them running from the store and driving away in their car.
Presenting the Decisive Evidence: The trial is underway. The prosecution has presented its first witness, Mrs. Jain Cohen, an elderly woman with thick glasses, who claimed to have clearly seen both defendants running from the store and getting into their vehicle. She described them and the car in great detail.
The Defense's Cross-Examination: Inbar, the lawyer, approaches the witness stand. Inbar: "Mrs. Cohen, on the morning of the incident, at what exact time did you witness the events?" Mrs. Cohen: "Oh, around 11 AM, when I finished my shopping." Inbar: "And were you wearing your glasses that day, ma'am?" Mrs. Cohen: "Yes, of course. I can't see without them." Inbar: "Excellent. And now, Mrs. Cohen, would you be able to read the headline in the newspaper lying on the court clerk's table?" Mrs. Cohen tries to sharpen her gaze, blinks, and leans in slightly. Mrs. Cohen: "I... I can't see it clearly. The letters are too small." Inbar: "Really? These letters are of normal size, ma'am. In fact, they're quite large relatively. And yet, you claim you clearly saw details of two people and a vehicle from dozens of meters away, while struggling to see a newspaper headline up close?" Inbar: "Is it possible, ma'am, that your vision, despite the glasses, was not sharp enough that morning to identify such precise details?" Mrs. Cohen: (stammering) "I... I think I did see." Inbar: "Just a moment, ma'am. Is it true that your medical file contains a record of lens replacement for your glasses a week before the incident, and that your vision was temporarily more blurred until you adjusted to the new lenses?" The prosecutor jumps up, shouting: "Objection, Your Honor! Speculation!" Judge: "Objection overruled. The defense may ask." Mrs. Cohen: (hesitantly) "I... yes, that's true. I had new glasses." Inbar: "Thank you, ma'am. I have no further questions."

Scenario 2: 
Background: Tomer and Stan are accused of murder. The prosecution claims they were the only ones seen in the store shortly before the murder and fleeing the scene afterward.
Presenting the Decisive Evidence: The trial is underway. The prosecution has presented the Sheriff's testimony confirming that Tomer and Stan were identified at the scene and fled, along with eyewitness testimonies. The Sheriff also testified that there was no active security camera in the store.
Presenting the Defense's Evidence: Inbar, the lawyer, calls Mr. Alon, the manager of a neighboring convenience store located across the street, to the witness stand. Inbar: "Mr. Alon, how long have you managed 'the tasty honey' store?" Mr. Alon: "About 15 years, Your Honor." Inbar: "Are there security cameras outside your store?" Mr. Alon: "Yes, I have a camera that films the main road and the entrance to my store, for security reasons." Inbar: "And on the morning of the incident, around 11:00 AM, was this camera active?" Mr. Alon: "Yes, it's always active." Inbar: "Did you check the footage from that morning?" Mr. Alon: "Absolutely. The police asked, but they didn't see anything unusual there." Inbar: "Your Honor, I would like to present to the court security footage received from Mr. Alon. The footage shows the time when Tomer and Stan left the 'Sac-O-Suds' store." The video is projected onto a large screen. Tomer and Stan's car is clearly seen driving away. A few seconds later, another person, who is neither Tomer nor Stan, is seen hastily exiting the nearby "Sac-O-Suds" store. Their face is not completely clear due to the distance, but it is clear that this is a completely different person. They get into a black car parked on the other side of the road and drive away quickly. Inbar: "Mr. Alon, is the person we saw in the video exiting the 'Sac-O-Suds' store one of the two defendants sitting here?" Mr. Alon: "No, sir. It's not them." Inbar: "Your Honor, please note: this video clearly proves that Tomer and Stan left the scene before the murder was committed, and that another person, unrelated to them, exited the store shortly thereafter. This indicates that another person is the killer." Inbar: "In light of the video, the Sheriff will need to re-investigate the eyewitness testimonies and examine the precise timing of the events."

Scenario 3: 
Background: Tomer and Stan are accused of murder. The prosecution relies on circumstantial evidence and efforts of eyewitnesses.
Presenting the Decisive Evidence: The trial is underway. The prosecution has presented circumstantial evidence and claimed the existence of some motive, although it was not entirely clear. Inbar managed to discredit some of the eyewitness testimonies, but doubt still exists.
Presenting the Prosecution's New Evidence: The prosecutor, Oren, calls the police detective responsible for collecting evidence from the scene, Detective Smith, to the witness stand. Oren: "Detective Smith, did you find any additional evidence at the crime scene that has not been revealed until now?" Detective Smith: "Yes, sir. After a thorough additional search, we found a small, hidden item inside a concealed pocket in the jacket worn by the defendant, Tomer Gambino." Oren: "And what is this item?" Detective Smith: "It's a receipt." Oren: "Can you describe the receipt, Detective Smith?" Detective Smith: "It's a small, printed receipt from a local auto parts store." Oren: "Can you tell us when the purchase was made according to the receipt?" Detective Smith: "Yes, sir. The date is the morning of the murder, about an hour before the defendants arrived at 'Sac-O-Suds'." Oren: "And what was purchased according to the receipt?" Detective Smith: "Thick work gloves, a specific type of industrial cleaning solution, and... a gun silencer were purchased." Sounds of commotion rise in the courtroom. Inbar and Lisa are stunned. Oren: "Detective Smith, are these items, and in particular the silencer, related to how the murder was committed?" Detective Smith: "Absolutely, sir. The bullet found in the victim's body underwent a slight modification indicating the use of a silencer, and the cleaning solution is similar to a substance found on the floor near the cash register."
